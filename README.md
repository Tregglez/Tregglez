**`Front-End Developer`**

I'm a front-end web developer with a strong focus on building high-quality and user-friendly web experiences. With an eye for detail, I approach each project with a clear plan and a passion for excellence. My goal is to create projects that are both aesthetically pleasing and highly functional, using my extensive knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring my designs to life. I have a dedication to learning and constantly strive to improve my skills, ensuring that each project I build is better than the last. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I have the drive and determination to deliver results, and are always looking for ways to push the boundaries of what is possible on the web.

  I have a passion for coding and have been self-taught in front-end development for some time. However, to further my skills, I decided to attend a Coding Bootcamp, where I learned and honed my skills in a structured environment. During the program, I gained an in-depth understanding of various coding languages and tools such as Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and Git. My hard work and dedication paid off, and I completed the program with flying colors, ready to tackle new challenges and continue building my skills. My journey into coding has been marked by a desire to learn and grow, and I'm now well on my way to becoming a top-notch front-end web developer.
